      <p>Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by
        trying to maneuver a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick.
        There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey and ice hockey.
        Often one variation of the sport, such as field hockey or ice hockey, will
        predominate in a certain area and be known simply as "hockey".

      <p>Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures.
        In Egypt, 4000-year-old carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, hurling dates to
        before 1272 BC in Ireland, and there is a depiction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece,
        where the game may have been called kerētízein or (κερητίζειν) because it was played with a horn or
        horn-like stick (kéras, κέρας).[5] In Inner Mongolia, the Daur people have been playing beikou,
        a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years. Most evidence of hockey-like
        games during the Middle Ages is found in legislation concerning sports and games.
        The Galway Statute enacted in Ireland in 1527 banned certain types of ball games,
        including games using "hooked" (written "hockie", similar to "hooky") sticks.
        ...at no tyme to use ne occupye the horlinge of the litill balle with hockie stickes or staves,
        nor use no hande ball to play withoute walles, but only greate foote balle.
        By the 19th century, the various forms and divisions of historic games began
        to differentiate and coalesce into the individual sports defined today.
        Organizations dedicated to the codification of rules and regulations began to
        form, and national and international bodies sprang up to manage domestic and
        international competition.

      <p>
        The objective of hockey is simple: score more goals than the opposing team. Players are not allowed to kick the puck into the net or purposely direct it in with any part of their body.
        During regulation time, each team uses five skaters—three forwards and two defencemen—plus a goaltender.
        National Hockey League games are contested over three 20-minute periods. If the score is tied after 60 minutes, the game moves to a five-minute, sudden-death overtime where the first goal wins.
        If the game remains tied after overtime, a shootout is held until a winner is determined.
        There are four officials in NHL games—two referees and two linesmen. They stop play for penalties and for things like offside or icing.
        Offside: when players enter the offensive zone before the puck gets there.
        Icing: when a team shoots from its side of the centre red line across the opposing goal line.
        Each play begins with a faceoff and ends when an official blows the whistle or a goal is scored.
